# MotoGearClone

This project was made by habibulloh ziyoyev, inspired by muhammad tohirov in january of 2025. It was just a practice run for me to see if I can re create the original mainpage of motogear shop which is owned by muhammad tohirov's big bros, so I am not in a position to hurt their copyrights and this website will not be used against the original one.

The project has mainly 3 files: complete.html, index.html and style.css. If you have no experience with html and css, you can see the complete webpage by downloading and opening complete.html. However, index.html contains the html elements of the webpage while style.css providing better appereance to the website.
